    news_content:
      "Daft Punk have joined Fortnite to offer an interactive experience for fans and players.Launching in the online video game on Saturday, 27th September at 2pm ET (7pm BST), the game's 'biggest' immersive music experience will feature 31 songs from Daft Punk's discography and will allow players to make mash-ups and Lego music videos of the group.Players will be able to create dancing avatars at the Daft Club, while a new bundle in the Fortnite Shop will also be available to purchase, which includes the group's TB3 and GM08 helmets, outfits, accessories, instruments and a 'Get Lucky' Jam Track. More info on 'The Daft Punk Experience' was available on the Fortnite site here, though at the time of writing the page displays an error message which says 'Re-accessing Memories' – a reference to the duo's final album, 'Random Access Memories'. Daft Punk split up in 2021, but have continued to reappear in various forms ever since. Last month, a limited edition Daft Punk skateboard went on the market for $15,000, while the duo collaborated with Los Angeles streetwear brand PLEASURES on three limited-edition pop-up stores this summer. Their animated film, Interstella 5555, was screened globally last year, and they released a drumless edition of 'Random Access Memories' in 2023. Ben Cardew explored the limits of the Daft Punk brand's existence in the aftermath of their split in this 2024 feature. Meanwhile, the LEGO recreation of Daft Punk's Alive 2007 live show progressed to the review stage for production consideration in April.Earlier this year, someone pretending to be Daft Punk’s Thomas Bangalter reportedly tricked ex-Kraftwerk member Wolfgang Flür into collaborating on his new album.
